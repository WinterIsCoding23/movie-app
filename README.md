## The Streaming-dilemma

(Nearly) Everybody faces the same struggle: Everything is ready for an amazing movie-night. But then: What movie will we watch? Every streaming-platform offers to save movies to watch in a watchlist. But watchlists are patient and grow over time. And grow. Until you face too many movies to handle and don't know anymore where to start - some people sooner, some later. Maybe just go to sleep instead? 

The Movie-App (production-name) aims to remedy this dilemma. 

## The proposition

As you are used to from other apps and streaming-platforms, in the Movie-App you can still save interesting movies in your Watchlist - and remove them as soon as you have watched them. Or grown tired of them after the eleventh re-watching. Also, every time you visit the app you get presented a random movie for inspiration. (In the future, it will also be possible to refine the suggested random movies according to either parameters set by the user or based on learning progress of an integrated AI.)

To make the movie-night a success though, the App suggests a movie from your Watchlist to spare you the scrolling hell. (As with the random movie-suggestion, one day soon it will be possible to base also this suggestion on a more refined fundament.)

So all that is left to say: Happy movie-watching! 

## Important note

To enjoy pure movie-bliss it is necessary to request an API-key from The Movie Database: https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs (please follow these instructions).

Please note, that this project is still work in progress. As it started as a pure demonstration-project, for the time being, it is connected to only one mongoDB-collection. In the future, it will be possible to log in as a registered user - and then access the user's private database.
